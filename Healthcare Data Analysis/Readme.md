## Introduction

In the scope of this project, our focus lies in delving into `Hospital Patients data` to extract `valuable insights` regarding the performance of diverse dining establishments. 

Employing SQL, we aim to efficiently `extract, transform, and analyze` the dataset. The outcomes of this analysis will be instrumental in comprehending the factors that `impact` a hospital performance, paving the way for strategic `recommendations` to enhance performance. 

Furthermore, we will conduct `sentiment analysis` to identify and analyze the most favorably reviewed restaurants, providing a comprehensive understanding of customer preferences.


## Schema

- A SQL database with the following tables: Patients, Doctors, Hospitals, Insurance, Medications, 
PatientAdmission

## Dataset

This dataset contains 5 tables, in CSV format:

- The `Doctor` table contains information Doctor Id and Full_Name of the Doctor (All records are unique)

- The `Hospitals` table contains Hospital ID and Name of Hospital (All records are unique)

- The `Insurances` table contains 5 different type of insurances

- The `Medications` table contains 5 types of medication

- The `PatientAdmission` table contains information of every PatientAdmission records

- The `Patiens` table contains Patient Demographics


## Recommended Analysis 

1. What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?

2. What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?

3. Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?

4. If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?



## Approach 

- `Data Acquisition`: Obtained restaurant ratings data from a publicly available source, importing it into an SQL database for further analysis.

- `Data Cleaning`: Utilized SQL to cleanse the data, ensuring it is formatted for easy analysis. Tasks included removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.

- `Information Extraction`: Employed SQL to extract pertinent details such as average restaurant ratings, review counts, and locations.

- `Advanced SQL Analysis`: Utilized advanced SQL commands and functions to delve into the datasets, identifying patterns and trends.

- `Metric Exploration`: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of various metrics using SQL commands and functions.

- `Recommendations for Improvement`: Leveraged insights gained from the analysis to provide recommendations for restaurant enhancement and proposed ways to use the data for informed business decisions
